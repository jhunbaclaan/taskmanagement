# About taskmanagement
'taskmanagement' (name wip) is an application created with the collaborative effort of Jhun Baclaan, Noel Ah Mook Sang, and Adriane Fiesta.
This application is a project for our CSCI-3911 class and is meant to be a demo of a web-based, user-friendly task management app.
# Concept
taskmanagement will be developed using HTML/CSS as a base, and implemented via Django. Django implementation means that there will be a local database that can be used to store
essential information like user info and task history. This makes it easier to keep track of what tasks you've already done, and it also means that you don't have to redo everything
if you accidentally close the app.
## Features (updated oct. 2, 2025)
There will be multiple screens that a user can access. For example, one of these screens will be a task creation screen, which allows the user to create tasks and give each task
basic information like a title, description, and due date.

Tasks will have the following features:
- Creation & deletion
- Titles
- Due dates
- Categories & priority levels
- General, manually-written descriptions and notes
- Editable details
- Filtering
- Locally stored on your system via a local Django database

As more features are added, this section will be updated to match.
